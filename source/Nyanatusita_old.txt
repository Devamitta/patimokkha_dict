Venerables, the four cases involving disqualification have been recited, a bhikkhu who has committed any one of them, does not obtain the communion
with bhikkhus. As [he was] before, so [he is] after [committing it]: he is one who is disqualified, not in communion. Concerning that I ask the Venerables:
[Are you] pure in this? A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this? A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this? The venerables are pure in this,
therefore there is silence, so do I bear this [in mind]. The recitation of the [cases involving] disqualification is finished[Saṅkhitta-pātimokkhuddesa]

community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].[Sd 6: Kuṭikārasikkhāpadaṃ] Saññācikāya pana bhikkhunā kuṭiṃ kārayamānena assāmikaṃ attuddesaṃ, pamāṇikā kāretabbā. Tatr`idaṃ pamāṇaṃ:

the sugata-span in length, [and] inside seven [spans] across. Bhikkhus are to be brought to [it] for appointing the site. By those bhikkhus a site is to be
appointed which is not entailing harm [to creatures and which is] having a surrounding space. If a bhikkhu, having requested it himself, should have a hut
built on a site entailing harm [to creatures], [and] not having a surrounding space, or if he should not bring bhikkhus to [it] for appointing the site, or if he
should let [it] exceed the measure: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].

undertaken, persist in upholding a legal issue conducive to schism. Let the venerable one convene with the community, for a united community, which is
on friendly terms, which is not disputing, which has a single recitation, dwells in comfort,” and [if] that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus
should persist in the same way [as before], [then] that bhikkhu is to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that [course],[and if that bhikkhu,] being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that [course], then this is good, [but] if he should not relinquish [it]: [this is a

speaking for [his] faction: one, or two, or three, [and] they should say so: “Venerables, don't say anything to this bhikkhu! This bhikkhu is one who speaks
in accordance with the Teaching and this bhikkhu is one who speaks in accordance the Discipline; this [bhikkhu], having received [our] consent and
favour defines [the Teaching & Discipline]. Knowing us, he speaks, [and] this suits us too.” [Then] those bhikkhus should be spoken to thus by the
bhikkhus: “Venerables, don't say so! This bhikkhu does not speak in accordance with the Teaching, and this bhikkhu does not speak in accordance with
the Discipline! Don't let the venerables too favour the schism of the community. Let there be convening with the community for the venerables, for a
united community, which is on friendly terms, which is not disputing, which has a single recitation, dwells in comfort,” and [if] those bhikkhus being

being righteously spoken to by the bhikkhus about the training precepts included in the recitation, he makes himself [one] who can not be spoken to
[saying]: “Venerables, don't say anything good or bad to me, and I too shall not say anything good or bad to the venerables! Venerables, refrain from
speaking to me!” [Then] that bhikkhu should be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Let the venerable one one not make himself [one] who cannot be
spoken to. Let the venerable one make himself [one] who can be spoken to. Let the venerable one speak to the bhikkhus with righteousness and the monks
too will speak to the venerable one with righteousness. For the Blessed One's assembly has grown thus, that is, by the speaking of one to another, by the
rehabilitating of one another,” and [if] that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way [as before], [then] that bhikkhu

village or town who is a spoiler of families, who is of bad behaviour. His bad behaviour is seen and is heard about, and the families spoilt by him are seen
and heard about. That bhikkhu is to be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “The venerable one is a spoiler of families, one who is of bad behaviour. The bad
behaviour of the venerable one is seen and is heard about, and the families spoilt by the venerable one are seen and are heard about. Let the venerable one
depart from this dwelling-place! Enough of you dwelling here!” and [if] that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should say thus to those
bhikkhus: “The bhikkhus are driven by desire; the bhikkhus are driven by anger; the bhikkhus are driven by delusion; the bhikkhus are driven by fear.
They banish someone because of this kind of offence, [but] another one they do not banish.” [Then] that bhikkhu is to be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus:
“Let the venerable one not speak thus! The bhikkhus are not driven by desire; and the bhikkhus are not driven by anger; and the bhikkhus are not driven
by delusion; and the bhikkhus are not driven by fear. The venerable one is a spoiler of families, one who is of bad behaviour. The bad behaviour of the

procedure] have been recited, nine [cases] are of the offence-at-once [-class], four [cases] are of the up-to the-third [time admonition-class]. A bhikkhu who
has committed any one of [these offenses], has to stay on probation with no choice [in the matter] for as many days as he knowingly conceals [it]. Moreover,
by a bhikkhu who has stayed on the probation, a six-night state of deference to [other] bhikkhus has to be entered upon. [When] the bhikkhu [is one by
whom] the deference has been performed: wherever there may be a community of bhikkhus, which is a group of twenty [or more bhikkhus], there that
bhikkhu should be reinstated. If a community of bhikkhus, which is a group of twenty deficient by even one [bhikkhu], should reinstate that bhikkhu
[then] that bhikkhu is not reinstated, and those monks are blameworthy. This is the proper procedure here. Concerning that I ask the venerables: [Are you]
pure in this? A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this? A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this? The venerables are pure in this, therefore
there is silence, so do I bear this [in mind]. The recitation concerning the community in the beginning and the rest [of the procedure] is finished.[Aniyatuddeso]
Ime kho panāyasmanto dve aniyatā dhammā uddesaṃ āgacchanti. [The recitation of the uncertain [cases]] Venerables, these two uncertain cases come up
for recitation.
[Aniy 1: Paṭhama-aniyatasikkhāpadaṃ] Yo pana bhikkhu mātugāmena saddhiṃ eko ekāya raho paṭicchanne āsane alaṅkammaniye nisajjaṃ kappeyya,
tam-enaṃ saddheyyavacasā upāsikā disvā tiṇṇaṃ dhammānaṃ aññatarena vadeyya: pārājikena vā saṅghādisesena vā pācittiyena vā, nisajjaṃ bhikku

tena so bhikkhu kāretabbo, ayaṃ dhammo aniyato. [The first uncertain training precept] If any bhikkhu should sit down together with a woman, one
[man] with one [woman], privately, on a concealed seat [that is] sufficiently fit for doing [it], [and then if] a female lay-follower whose words can be trusted
having seen that, should speak according to one of three cases: according to disqualification, according to what concerns the community in the beginning
and in the rest [of the procedure], or according to expiation, [then] the bhikkhu who is admitting the sitting down should be made to do [what is] according
to one of three cases: according to disqualification, or according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure], or
according to expiation, or according to whatever that female lay-follower whose words can be trusted should say, according to that the bhikkhu is to be
made to do. This is an uncertain case.
[Aniy 2: Dutiya-aniyatasikkhāpadaṃ] Na heva kho pana paṭicchannaṃ āsanaṃ hoti nālaṅkammaniyaṃ, alañ-ca kho hoti mātugāmaṃ duṭṭhullāhi vācāhi

kāretabbo saṅghādisesena vā pācittiyena vā, yena vā sā saddheyyavacasā upāsikā vadeyya, tena so bhikkhu kāretabbo, ayam-pi dhammo aniyato. [The
second uncertain training precept] But even if the seat is neither concealed nor sufficiently fit for doing it, but is sufficient for speaking suggestively to a
woman with depraved words: if any bhikkhu should sit down on such a seat together with a woman—one [man] with one [woman], privately—[and then
if] a female lay-follower whose words can be trusted having seen that, should speak according to one of two cases: according to what concerns the
community in the beginning and in the rest, or according to expiation, [then] the bhikkhu admitting the sitting down is to be made to do according to one
of two cases: according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure], or according to expiation, or according to
whatever that female lay-follower whose words can be trusted should say, according to that the bhikkhu is to be made to do, this too is an uncertain case.
[Aniyata conclusion] Uddiṭṭhā kho āyasmanto dve aniyatā dhammā. Tatthāyasmante pucchāmi: Kacci'ttha parisuddhā? Dutiyam-pi pucchāmi: Kacci'ttha
parisuddhā? Tatiyam-pi pucchāmi: Kacci'ttha parisuddhā? Parisuddh'etthāyasmanto, tasmā tuṇhī, evam-etaṃ dhārayāmi. Aniyatuddeso niṭṭhito.
Venerables, the two uncertain cases have been recited. Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this? A second time again I ask: [Are you]
pure in this? A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this? The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I bear this [in mind]. The
recitation of the uncertain [cases] is finished.
[Nissaggiya pācittiyā]
Ime kho panāyasmanto tiṃsa nissaggiyā pācittiyā dhammā uddesaṃ āgacchanti. [The (cases) involving expiation with forfeiture] Venerables, these thirty

cloth] should become available to a bhikkhu, by a bhikkhu who is wishing [so, it] can be accepted; having accepted [it, it] is to be made very quickly. If
[the robe-cloth] should not be [enough for] the completion [of the robe], [then] for a month at the most that robe [-cloth] can be put aside by that bhikkhu
for the completion of the deficiency [of robe-cloth], when there is an expectation [that he will get more robe-cloth]; if he should put [it] aside more than
that, even when there is an expectation [that he will get more robe-cloth], [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture.

lost; this is the occasion here.

suggestion is made] out of a liking for what is fine, [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture.

or a kings’ official or a brahmin or a male householder should convey by messenger a robe-fund for a bhikkhu [saying]: “Having traded this robe-fund for
a robe, clothe the bhikkhu named so and so with a robe,” and if that messenger, having approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, this robe-
fund has been brought for the venerable one. Let the venerable one accept the robe-fund!” [then] that messenger should be spoken to thus by that bhikkhu:
“Sir, we do not accept a robe-fund, but we do accept a robe at the right time [when it is] allowable.” If that messenger should say thus to that bhikkhu: “Is
there, perhaps, someone who is the steward of the venerable one?” [then,] bhikkhus, by a bhikkhu who is in need of a robe a steward can be appointed: a
monastery attendant or a male lay-follower [saying]: “Sir, this is the bhikkhus' steward.” If that messenger having instructed that steward, having
approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, the steward whom the venerable one has appointed has been instructed by me. Let the venerable
one approach [him] at the right time [and] he will clothe you with a robe,” [then] bhikkhus, having approached the steward, [the steward] can be prompted
[and] can be reminded two or three times by the bhikkhu who is in need of a robe [saying]: “Sir, I am in need of a robe.” [If through] prompting [and]
reminding [him] two or three times, he should have [him] bring forth that robe, it is good. If he should not have [him] bring [it] forth, [then] four times,
five times, six times at the most, [it] can be stood [for] by [a bhikkhu] who has become silent. [If through] standing silently for [it] four times, five times, six
times at the most, he should have [him] bring forth that robe, it is good; if [through] making effort more than that, he should have [him] produce that robe,
[this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture. If he should not have [him] produce [it], [then] from wherever [that] the robe-fund may have been
brought, there [he] himself can go, or a messenger can be sent [saying]: “Sirs, that robe-fund which you conveyed for the bhikkhu does not fulfil any need
of that bhikkhu. Let the sirs endeavour for [what is their] own. Let not [what is their] own get lost.” This is the proper procedure here. The section [starting

committed a blameworthy act which is unsuitable, which is to be acknowledged; I acknowledge it.”

have been invited are eating among families, and if a bhikkhunī who is giving directions is standing there [saying], “Give curry here, give rice here!”
[then] by those bhikkhus that bhikkhunī is to be dismissed [saying], “Go away, sister, for as long as the bhikkhus eat!,” and if not even one bhikkhu
would speak against [it, so as] to dismiss that bhikkhunī [saying], “Go away, sister, for as long as the bhikkhus eat!,” [then it] is to be acknowledged by
those bhikkhus, “Friend[s], we have committed a blameworthy act which is unsuitable, which is to be acknowledged; we acknowledge it.”

food having accepted [it] with his own hand in families who are of such a kind, who are considered trainees, [then it] is to be acknowledged by that
bhikkhu: “Friend[s], I have committed a blameworthy act which is unsuitable, which is to be acknowledged; I acknowledge it.”
[Pd 4: Catutthapāṭidesanīyasikkhāpadaṃ] Yāni kho pana tāni āraññakāni senāsanāni sāsaṅkasammatāni sappaṭibhayāni, yo pana bhikkhu tathārūpesu

tena bhikkhunā: “Gārayhaṃ āvuso dhammaṃ āpajjiṃ, asappāyaṃ, pāṭidesanīyaṃ, taṃ paṭidesemī ti.” [The fourth training precept on what is to be
acknowledged] Now, [there are] those those wilderness lodgings which are considered risky, which are dangerous: if any bhikkhu, [staying] in lodgings
which are of such a kind, without having announced [the danger] beforehand, having accepted [the food] with his own hand inside the monastery, [and
then] not being ill, should chew uncooked food or eat cooked food, [then it] is to be acknowledged by that bhikkhu, “Friend[s], I have committed a
blameworthy act which is unsuitable, which is to be acknowledged; I acknowledge it.”

Ime kho panāyasmanto satta adhikaraṇasamathā dhammā uddesaṃ āgacchanti. [The settlements of legal issues] Venerables, these seven cases that are
settlements of legal issues come up for recitation. Uppannuppannānaṃ adhikaraṇānaṃ samathāya vūpasamāya: sammukhāvinayo dātabbo, sativinayo
dātabbo, amūḷhavinayo dātabbo, paṭiññāya kāretabbo, yebhuyyasikā, tassapāpiyyasikā, tiṇavatthārako ti. For the calming, for the stilling of whichever
legal issues have arisen: the removal through the presence [of the bhikkhu] is to be given, the removal [of the accusation] through remembrance is to be
given, the removal [of the accusation] through not [being] insane is to be given, he is to be made to do [the offenceprocedure] through admitting [the
offence], the [decision of the] majority, [the decision making it] worse for him, [the decision] covering [the offences as if] with grass.
[Adhikaraṇa Conclusion] Uddiṭṭhā kho āyasmanto satta adhikaraṇasamathā dhammā. Tatthāyasmante pucchāmi: Kacci'ttha parisuddhā? Dutiyam-pi
pucchāmi: Kacci'ttha parisuddhā? Tatiyam-pi pucchāmi: Kacci'ttha parisuddhā? Parisuddh'etthāyasmanto, tasmā tuṇhī, evam-etaṃ dhārayāmi.
Adhikaraṇasamathā niṭṭhitā. Recited, Venerables, have been the seven cases that are settlements of legal issues. Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are
you] pure in this? A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this? A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this? The venerables are pure in this,
therefore there is silence, thus I keep this [in mind]. The cases that are settlements of legal issues have finished.
