Bhikkhupātimokkha

“The Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, has prescribed the course of training for bhikkhus and he has laid down the Pātimokkha. On the Uposatha day as many of us as live in dependence upon a single village district meet together in unison, and when we meet we ask one who knows the Pā timokkha to recite it. If a bhikkhu remembers an offence or a transgression while the Pā timokkha is being recited, we make him act in accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with the instructions. It is not the worthy ones that make us act; it is the Dhamma that makes us act.”

(MN 108)

Preliminary Duties




* * *



May the Senior please give me permission to recite the Pāṭimokkha.

〈 Eldest Bhikkhu: “I give permission to the Venerable one.” 〉 Before doing the Uposatha the ninefold duty should be done:

The sweeping of that place; the lighting of the lamp there; the spreading of the sitting mats; the setting out of water for drinking and washing the bringing of the consent of the bhikkhus who are deserving [to give their] consent; and of those bhikkhus who do not participate in the Uposatha the bringing of the purity too; the telling of the season; the counting of the bhikkhus, and the instructing of the bhikkhunīs.

Herein with regards the first four duties there is no duty of [lighting] the lamp because of the state of there being sunlight now, the three other ones have been done and completed by monastery-attendants who know the bhikkhus’ protocol and by bhikkhus.

[At night:] Herein with regards the first four duties there is no duty of [lighting] the lamp because of the state of there being sunlight now, the three other ones have been done and completed by bhikkhus who know the bhikkhus’ protocol.

There is no bringing of consent [and] bringing of purity because of the absence in this boundary of seated bhikkhus who have left arm’s length.

The so-called “telling the season” is declaring the season thus: this number [of Uposathas] have passed, this number [of Uposathas] are left. In this dispensation there are three seasons, [namely] winter,summer, and rains.

This is the * season, and in this season there are eight Uposathas.

With this fortnight:

One Uposatha has arrived,

# Uposathas have past,

# Uposathas are left.

Thus the telling of the season is to be borne in mind by all the venerables.

〈 “So it is, Venerable Sir! / Friend!” 〉

The so-called “counting of the bhikkhus” is the counting of the bhikkhus [thus]: “In this Uposatha hall so many bhikkhus have gathered for the purpose of [performing] the Uposatha”. In this Uposatha-hall four bhikkhus have gathered.

〈 “So it is, Venerable Sir! / Friend!” 〉

There is no instruction of the bhikkhunīs because of their non-existence in the proximity.

Thus, because of the state of having been done of the preliminary duties, which had an opportunity of doing (them), and because of the naturalness of the preliminary duties which had no opportunity of doing (them), the nine-fold Preliminary Function has been completed.

When the preliminary duty has been finished: If the day is a certain one of the fourteenth, fifteenth or the Unity, like today is the fifteenth day Uposatha.

Whatever bhikkhus are entitled [to carry out the legal] act, who are qualified for the Uposatha of the Community, four or more than that, regular, who have not committed an offence of pārājika, who have not been suspended by the Community,

and they, not having left arms-length, remain in one boundary,

and if among them common offences, founded on eating at the wrong time and so on, are not found,

and if among them within arms-length there is no person fit to be excluded, who is to be excluded from arms-length by making [him go] outside,

then that [legal] act of Uposatha endowed with these four characteristics is called “[one that] has reached suitability”, [and is] fit to perform.

Having known the state of reached suitability of the [legal] act of Uposatha, it is to be approved of by the Community [that] the Uposatha is being done now”.



〈 “So it is, Venerable Sir! / Friend!” 〉

〈 Eldest Bhikkhu: “Having made to undertake the preparations and preliminary duties I make the invitation to recite the Disciplinary Code with the approval of the seated community.” 〉





The Recitation of the Introduction




* * *



Venerable Sir, let the Community listen to me! Today is a fifteenth / fourteenth / unity [day] Observance. If it is suitable to the Community, [then] the Community should do the Observance [and] should recite the Disciplinary Code.

What is the preliminary for the Community?

Venerables, announce the purity, [for] I shall recite the Disciplinary Code. Let us all [who are] present listen to it carefully [and] let us take it to mind. Whoever may have an offence, he should disclose [it]. When there is no offence, [then it] is to be silent. By the silence I shall know the Venerables [with the thought]: “[They are] pure.”

As an answer occurs to [a bhikkhu] who is asked individually, just so in such an assembly [as this one] there is the announcement up to the third time. But if any bhikkhu, [who is] remembering [an offence] when the announcement is being made up to the third time, should not disclose the existing offence, there is [a further offence of] deliberate false speech for him. But, venerables, deliberate false speech has been called an obstructive act by the Fortunate One. Therefore, by a bhikkhu who is remembering, who has committed [an offence], who is desiring purification, an existing offence is to be disclosed; because, [after] having disclosed [it], there is comfort for him.

Venerables, the introduction has been recited.

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?

A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, so do I bear this [in mind].

The recitation of the introduction is finished





Beheadings




* * *



Herein these four cases involving disqualification come up for recitation.





Disqualification 1: The training precept on the act of sexual intercourse


If any bhikkhu [who] has entered upon the training and livelihood for bhikkhus, not having rejected the training, not having disclosed [his] incapability, should engage in the act of sexual intercourse, even with just a female animal, he is disqualified, not in communion.





Disqualification 2: The training precept on the taking of what has not been given


If any bhikkhu should take [what has] not been given from a village or wilderness-area, which is reckoned as theft, [and] the taking of what has not been given [is] of the kind [that] on account of [it] kings, having caught the robber, would physically punish or imprison or banish [him, saying]: “You are a robber! You are a fool! You are insane! You are a thief!,” a bhikkhu taking [what has] not been given of such a kind, is also disqualified, not in communion.





Disqualification 3: The training precept on (killing) a human being


If any bhikkhu should deliberately deprive a human being of life, or should seek an assassin for him, or should praise the attractiveness of death, or should incite [him] to death [saying]: “Dear man, what [use] is this bad, wretched life for you? Death is better than life for you!” should he, [having] such thought-and mind, [having such-] thought-and-intention, praise in manifold ways the beauty of death or incite [him] to death, he also is disqualified, not in communion.





Disqualification 4: The training precept on superhuman states


If any bhikkhu, [though] not directly knowing [it], should claim a superhuman state pertaining to himself, [a state of] knowing and seeing [that is] suitable for the noble [ones], [saying]: “Thus I know! Thus I see!,” [and] then, on another occasion, [whether] being interrogated or not being interrogated, having committed [the offence], desiring purification, should say so: “[Although] not knowing [it,] I spoke thus [saying]: ’I know,’ not seeing [it, I spoke, saying:] ’I see.’ I bluffed vainly [and] falsely,” except [when said] in overestimation, he also is disqualified, not in communion.

Venerables, the four cases involving disqualification have been recited.

A bhikkhu who has committed any one of them, does not obtain the communion with bhikkhus. As [he was] before, so [he is] after [committing it]: he is one who is disqualified, not in communion.

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?

A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, so do I bear this [in mind].

The recitation of the [cases involving] disqualification is finished





Cases Concerning the Community




* * *



Venerables, these thirteen cases [concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure] come up for recitation.





Community Meeting 1: The training precept on emission of semen


The intentional emission of semen, except in a dream: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 2: The training precept on physical contact


If any bhikkhu, under the influence of an altered mind, should engage in [intimate] physical contact together with a woman [such as]: the holding of a hand, or holding a braid [of hair], or caressing any limb: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 3: The training precept on depraved words


If any bhikkhu, under the influence of an altered mind, should speak suggestively with depraved words to a woman, like a young man to a young woman, [with words] concerned with sexual intercourse: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 4: The training precept on (ministering) to himself with love


If any bhikkhu, under the influence of an altered mind, [and] in the presence of a woman, should speak praise about the ministering to himself with sex: “Sister, this is the best of ministerings: she who would minister to a virtuous, good natured celibate like me with this act!,” [which is something] connected with sexual intercourse: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 5: The training precept on mediating


If any bhikkhu should engage in mediating a man’s intention to a woman, or a woman’s intention to a man, for being a wife or for being a mistress, even for being one on [just] that occasion: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 6: The training precept on making a hut


By a bhikkhu who is having a hut, which is without an owner, [and] is designated for himself, built by means of his own begged requisites, [that hut] is to be built according to the [proper] measure. This is the measure here: twelve spans of the sugata-span in length, [and] inside seven [spans] across. Bhikkhus are to be brought to [it] for appointing the site. By those bhikkhus a site is to be appointed which is not entailing harm [to creatures and which is] having a surrounding space. If a bhikkhu, having requested it himself, should have a hut built on a site entailing harm [to creatures], [and] not having a surrounding space, or if he should not bring bhikkhus to [it] for appointing the site, or if he should let [it] exceed the measure: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 7: The training precept on making a dwelling


By a bhikkhu who is having a large dwelling built, which has an owner, [and] is designated for himself, bhikkhus are to be brought to [it] for appointing the site. By those bhikkhus a site not entailing harm [to any creatures] [and] having a surrounding space is to be appointed. If a bhikkhu should have a hut built on a site entailing harm [to creatures], [and] not having a surrounding space, or if he should not bring bhikkhus to [it] for appointing the site, [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 8: The training precept on being corrupted by malice


If any bhikkhu, corrupted by malice [and] upset, should accuse a bhikkhu with a groundless case involving disqualification [thinking]: “If only I could make him fall away from this holy life!,” [and] then, on another occasion, [whether] being interrogated or not being interrogated, if that legal issue is really groundless, and if the bhikkhu stands firm in malice: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 9: The training precept on (an issue) belonging to another class


If any bhikkhu, corrupted by malice [and] upset, should accuse a bhikkhu with a case involving disqualification, having taken [it] up [with] some point, which is a mere pretext, of a legal issue belonging to another class [thinking]: “If only I could make him fall away from this holy life!,” [and] then, on another occasion, [whether] being interrogated or not being interrogated, if that legal issue is really belonging to another class, [and] some point, which a mere pretext, has been taken up, and if the bhikkhu stands firm in malice: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 10: The training precept on the schism of a community


If any bhikkhu should endeavor for the schism of a united community, or having undertaken, should persist in upholding a legal issue conducive to schism, [then] that bhikkhu should be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Let the venerable one not endeavor for the schism of the united community, or having undertaken, persist in upholding a legal issue conducive to schism. Let the venerable one convene with the community, for a united community, which is on friendly terms, which is not disputing, which has a single recitation, dwells in comfort,” and [if] that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way [as before], [then] that bhikkhu is to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that [course], [and if that bhikkhu,] being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that [course], then this is good, [but] if he should not relinquish [it]: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 11: The training precept on the followers of the schism


Now, there are bhikkhus who are followers of that same bhikkhu, [and] who are speaking for [his] faction: one, or two, or three, [and] they should say so: “Venerables, don’t say anything to this bhikkhu! This bhikkhu is one who speaks in accordance with the Teaching and this bhikkhu is one who speaks in accordance the Discipline; this [bhikkhu], having received [our] consent and favour defines [the Teaching & Discipline]. Knowing us, he speaks, [and] this suits us too.” [Then] those bhikkhus should be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Venerables, don’t say so! This bhikkhu does not speak in accordance with the Teaching, and this bhikkhu does not speak in accordance with the Discipline! Don’t let the venerables too favour the schism of the community. Let there be convening with the community for the venerables, for a united community, which is on friendly terms, which is not disputing, which has a single recitation, dwells in comfort,” and [if] those bhikkhus being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way [as before], [then] those bhikkhus are to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that [course], [and if those bhikkhus] being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that [course], then this is good, [but] if they should not relinquish [it]: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 12: The training precept on being of a nature difficult to be spoken to


Now, a bhikkhu is of a nature difficult to be spoken to, [and when] being righteously spoken to by the bhikkhus about the training precepts included in the recitation, he makes himself [one] who can not be spoken to [saying]: “Venerables, don’t say anything good or bad to me, and I too shall not say anything good or bad to the venerables! Venerables, refrain from speaking to me!” [Then] that bhikkhu should be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Let the venerable one one not make himself [one] who cannot be spoken to. Let the venerable one make himself [one] who can be spoken to. Let the venerable one speak to the bhikkhus with righteousness and the monks too will speak to the venerable one with righteousness. For the Blessed One’s assembly has grown thus, that is, by the speaking of one to another, by the rehabilitating of one another,” and [if] that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way [as before], [then] that bhikkhu is to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that [course], [and if that bhikkhu,] being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that [course], then this is good, [but] if he should not relinquish [it]: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].





Community Meeting 13: The training precept on the spoiler of families


Now, a bhikkhu lives dependent upon a certain village or town who is a spoiler of families, who is of bad behaviour. His bad behaviour is seen and is heard about, and the families spoilt by him are seen and heard about. That bhikkhu is to be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “The venerable one is a spoiler of families, one who is of bad behaviour. The bad behaviour of the venerable one is seen and is heard about, and the families spoilt by the venerable one are seen and are heard about. Let the venerable one depart from this dwelling-place! Enough of you dwelling here!” and [if] that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should say thus to those bhikkhus: “The bhikkhus are driven by desire; the bhikkhus are driven by anger; the bhikkhus are driven by delusion; the bhikkhus are driven by fear. They banish someone because of this kind of offence, [but] another one they do not banish.” [Then] that bhikkhu is to be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Let the venerable one not speak thus! The bhikkhus are not driven by desire; and the bhikkhus are not driven by anger; and the bhikkhus are not driven by delusion; and the bhikkhus are not driven by fear. The venerable one is a spoiler of families, one who is of bad behaviour. The bad behaviour of the venerable one is seen and is heard about, and the families spoilt by the venerable one are seen and are heard about. Let the venerable one depart from this dwelling-place! Enough of you dwelling here!” and [if] that bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way [as before], [then] that bhikkhu is to be argued with up to three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that [course], [and if that bhikkhu,] being argued with up to three times, should relinquish that [course], then this is good, [but] if he should not relinquish [it]: [this is a case concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure].

Venerables, the thirteen cases [concerning] the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure] have been recited.

Nine [cases] are of the offence-at-once [-class], four [cases] are of the up-to the-third [time admonition-class]. A bhikkhu who has committed any one of [these offenses], has to stay on probation with no choice [in the matter] for as many days as he knowingly conceals [it]. Moreover, by a bhikkhu who has stayed on the probation, a six-night state of deference to [other] bhikkhus has to be entered upon. [When] the bhikkhu [is one by whom] the deference has been performed: wherever there may be a community of bhikkhus, which is a group of twenty [or more bhikkhus], there that bhikkhu should be reinstated. If a community of bhikkhus, which is a group of twenty deficient by even one [bhikkhu], should reinstate that bhikkhu [then] that bhikkhu is not reinstated, and those monks are blameworthy. This is the proper procedure here.

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?

A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, so do I bear this [in mind].

The recitation concerning the community in the beginning and the rest [of the procedure] is finished





Uncertain Cases




* * *



Venerables, these two uncertain cases come up for recitation.





Uncertain Case 1: The first uncertain training precept


If any bhikkhu should sit down together with a woman, one [man] with one [woman], privately, on a concealed seat [that is] sufficiently fit for doing [it], [and then if] a female lay-follower whose words can be trusted having seen that, should speak according to one of three cases: according to disqualification, according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure], or according to expiation, [then] the bhikkhu who is admitting the sitting down should be made to do [what is] according to one of three cases: according to disqualification, or according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure], or according to expiation, or according to whatever that female lay-follower whose words can be trusted should say, according to that the bhikkhu is to be made to do. This is an uncertain case.





Uncertain Case 2: The second uncertain training precept


But even if the seat is neither concealed nor sufficiently fit for doing it, but is sufficient for speaking suggestively to a woman with depraved words: if any bhikkhu should sit down on such a seat together with a woman—one [man] with one [woman], privately—[and then if] a female lay-follower whose words can be trusted having seen that, should speak according to one of two cases: according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest, or according to expiation, [then] the bhikkhu admitting the sitting down is to be made to do according to one of two cases: according to what concerns the community in the beginning and in the rest [of the procedure], or according to expiation, or according to whatever that female lay-follower whose words can be trusted should say, according to that the bhikkhu is to be made to do, this too is an uncertain case.

Venerables, the two uncertain cases have been recited.

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?

A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I bear this [in mind].

The recitation of the uncertain [cases] is finished





Forfeiture and Expiations




* * *



Venerables, these thirty cases involving expiation with forfeiture come up for recitation.





The Section on Robes



Forfeiture and Expiation 1: The training precept on the kaṭhina


When the robe [-cloth] has been finished by a bhikkhu, when the kaṭhina [-frame-privileges] have been withdrawn, [then] extra robe [-cloth] is to be kept for ten days at the most. For one who lets it pass beyond [the ten days], [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture.





Forfeiture and Expiation 2: The training precept on the storehouse


When the robe [-cloth] has been finished by a bhikkhu, when the kaṭhina [-frame-privileges] have been withdrawn, if even for a single night a bhikkhu should stay apart from the three robes, except with the authorization of bhikkhus, [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture.





Forfeiture and Expiation 3: The training precept on the out-of-season (robe)-cloth


When the robe [-cloth] has been finished by a bhikkhu, when the kaṭhina [-frame-privileges] have been withdrawn, if out-of-season robe [cloth] should become available to a bhikkhu, by a bhikkhu who is wishing [so, it] can be accepted; having accepted [it, it] is to be made very quickly. If [the robe-cloth] should not be [enough for] the completion [of the robe], [then] for a month at the most that robe [-cloth] can be put aside by that bhikkhu for the completion of the deficiency [of robe-cloth], when there is an expectation [that he will get more robe-cloth]; if he should put [it] aside more than that, even when there is an expectation [that he will get more robe-cloth], [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture.





Forfeiture and Expiation 4: The training precept on the used (robe)-cloth


If any bhikkhu should have a used robe [-cloth] washed, dyed, or beaten by an unrelated bhikkhunī, [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture.





Forfeiture and Expiation 5: The training precept on the acceptance of robe(-cloth)


If any bhikkhu should accept a robe [-cloth] from the hand of an unrelated bhikkhunī, except in an exchange [of robes], [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture.





Forfeiture and Expiation 6: The training precept on making a suggestion to someone who is not related


If any bhikkhu should request a robe [-cloth] to an unrelated male householder or female householder, except at the [right] occasion, [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture. Here the occasion is this: he is a bhikkhu whose robe has been robbed or whose robe has been lost; this is the occasion here.





Forfeiture and Expiation 7: The training precept on (accepting) more than that


If the unrelated male householder or female householder should invite him to take [as many] robe [-cloth]s [as he likes], [then] robe [-cloths for] an upper [robe] together with an inner [robe] can be accepted at the most from that robe [-cloth] by that bhikkhu; if he should accept more from that [robe-cloth], [this is a case] involving expiation with forfeiture.

Don’t misrepresent the Fortunate One; for the misrepresentation of the Fortunate One is not good; for the Fortunate One would not say so; friend novice, [that] obstructive acts are [really] obstructive is spoken of in manifold ways by the Fortunate One and they are enough to be an obstruction for the one who is engaging [in them],” and if that novice being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the same way [as before], [then] that novice is to be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus, “From today on, friend novice, the Fortunate One is not to be referred to as the teacher by you, and also the two or three nights sleeping together [in one room] with bhikkhus that other novices get, that too is not for you. Go away, disappear!”

If any bhikkhu knowingly should treat kindly such an expelled novice, or should make [him] attend [to himself], or should eat together with [him], or should use a sleeping place together with [him], [this is a case] involving expiation.
